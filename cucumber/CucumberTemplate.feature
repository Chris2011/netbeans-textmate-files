Feature: Manage Articles
    # Main goal of this project
    In order to make a blog
    As an author
    I want to create and manage articles

    Scenario: Articles List
        Given I have articles titled Pizza, Breadsticks
        When I go to the list of articles
        Then I should see "Pizza"
        And I should see "Breadsticks"

    Scenario: Create Valid Article
        Given I have no articles
        And I am on the list of articles
        When I follow "New Article"
        And I fill in "Title" with "Spuds"
        And I fill in "Content" with "Delicious potato wedges!"
        And I press "Create"
        Then I should see "New article created."
        And I should see "Spuds"
        And I should see "Delicious potato wedges!"
        And I should have 1 article
