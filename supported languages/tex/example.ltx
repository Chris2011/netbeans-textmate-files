Why don't air molecules fall to the ground?  The answer has to do with
air pressure.  If we could remove all the air from a container, except
for a single air molecule, that molecule would certainly fall to the
bottom.  We would say the air pressure in that container is zero.  Now
put all of the air back as before.  At ordinary temperatures the
molecules are zipping around randomly and jostling each other.  This
is the source of air pressure.  So our single air molecule is buffeted
by its neighbors.  If it tries to fall to the bottom, the others tend
to bump it back up.  

Gravity still has an effect, because the air pressure at the bottom of
the container is slightly higher than at the top.  So the more our
molecule tries to move down, the more it is jostled by its neighbors,
and the more it feels itself crowded back up.  It is actually the
balance between this pressure variation and the pull of gravity that
is responsible for keeping our molecule at the same height.  This
argument applies to any molecule in the vessel or even in our
atmosphere.  So we can thank our ordinary temperatures and pressures
that the air stays more or less at the same height.
